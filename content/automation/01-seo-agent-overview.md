# 🧠 SEO Agent — Concept & Architecture

> 📌 TL;DR: Input a URL. The agent crawls, retrieves GSC and SERP data, compares you vs competitors, picks focus keywords, recommends structure/content/technical fixes, optionally drafts copy, validates against rules, and delivers a clear action plan.

---

## 1) Goal

- Input: a URL (e.g., your service page)
- Output: a ranked action plan and (optional) draft copy to improve keywords, content, and structure to rank better

---

## 2) Core Capabilities

- Data collection: crawl page, pull Search Console queries, scrape competitor SERPs
- Analysis: gap detection (subtopics, headings, FAQs), semantic coverage, readability, on-page checks
- Decision-making: primary/secondary keyword recommendations, structure changes, technical fixes
- Output: concrete “Change X/Add Y/Target Z” plan; optional drafted title/meta/sections

---

## 3) Agentic Loop

1. Define goal → improve rankings for the URL
2. Retrieve data → crawl HTML, fetch GSC, scrape SERPs (top 5–10)
3. Analyze → compare content vs competitors; detect gaps and intent
4. Decide → choose target keyword(s) and structural improvements
5. Draft → title/meta/outline or content blocks
6. Validate → rules: title length, keyword presence, readability, internal links, alt text
7. Deliver → prioritized recommendations and optional drafts

---

## 4) Contracts (Inputs/Outputs)

Input:
- url, locale?, target_keyword? (optional), gsc_credentials? (optional)

Outputs:
- audit.json: on-page signals + issues
- serp.json: competitors, SERP features, headings
- analysis.json: gaps, entities, intent, coverage metrics
- plan.md: prioritized actions with rationale
- drafts.json (optional): title/meta/outline/paragraphs

---

## 5) Phased Build Plan

- Phase 1 — Page Auditor: extract signals, run checks, output fix list
- Phase 2 — Competitor Comparator: for one keyword, compare top SERPs vs your page
- Phase 3 — Keyword Recommender: combine GSC + competitor coverage to pick focus keywords
- Phase 4 — Structure & Content Suggestor: generate outline and FAQ suggestions
- Phase 5 — AI Drafting: suggest title/meta and draft gap content
- Phase 6 — Full Agentic Loop: automate Define→Retrieve→Analyze→Decide→Draft→Validate→Deliver

---

## 6) Tech Stack

- Data: Requests/BS4/Playwright, GSC API, Trends (optional)
- Analysis: embeddings for semantic coverage; rules for SEO checks
- Agent: LLM to summarize/justify and draft copy
- Output: Markdown report and/or dashboard; optional CMS integration

---

## 7) Guardrails & QA

- Respect robots.txt; rate-limit scraping
- Validate LLM outputs against JSON schemas and SEO rules
- Add provenance: show which SERP/competitor informed each recommendation
- Human-in-the-loop approvals for publish actions

---

## 8) Example Recommendation

- Title: “SEO Services Mytchett & Camberley | Ellie Edwards”
- Meta: “Affordable SEO packages for Mytchett & Camberley businesses...”
- Add: section on “SEO Packages & Pricing in Camberley” and FAQ “How long does SEO take?”
- Note: expand to ~1,200 words and add alt text to hero image
