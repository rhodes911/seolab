## 🧱 Structuring Your Seeds

| Field | Example | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Seed | "email marketing" | Short core concept |
| Tag: product | "automation platform" | Your offering context |
| Tag: audience | "SMB", "B2B" | Who it’s for |
| Tag: problem | "newsletter growth" | Problem language |

> [!WARNING] Don’t overfit to internal jargon. If customers say "newsletter tool" more than "ESP", prefer the former.
