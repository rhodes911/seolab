    question: What’s a reliable signal that two keywords belong in the same cluster?
    type: single
    options:
      - text: Similar monthly search volume
        correct: false
      - text: High SERP overlap in the top results
        correct: true
        explain: Overlap indicates Google views them as the same intent/topic.
      - text: Same number of words
        correct: false

# 🧬 Keyword Clustering

> 📌 **TL;DR:** Cluster keywords that share intent. Use SERP result overlap to validate. Build hubs and spokes to cover each topic comprehensively.

---

## 🧪 Clustering Approaches

- Rule-based: group by stem/modifier rules (fast, coarse)
- SERP-based: group if top 10 results overlap ≥ X%
- Embeddings: vector similarity → cluster (requires tooling)

## 🕸️ From Cluster to Site Structure

```
[Hub: CRM for SMB]
  ├─ what is a crm
  ├─ crm vs spreadsheet
  ├─ best crm for small business
  ├─ crm pricing comparison
  └─ how to migrate from excel to crm
```

> [!TIP] One page per intent. If two queries show nearly identical SERPs, consolidate into one page and target both.

## 🔍 Validation Checklist

- SERP intent match across queries in the cluster
- Minimal cannibalization with existing pages
- Clear internal link path from hub to spokes

---

## ✅ Clustering Checklist

- [ ] Choose a clustering approach (rule-based, SERP-based, or embeddings)
- [ ] Use SERP overlap to validate clusters
- [ ] Define hub vs. spoke pages for each cluster
- [ ] Avoid creating multiple pages for same intent
- [ ] Plan internal links hub ⇄ spokes

- SERP overlap tools; manual checks remain essential
