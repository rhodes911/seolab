# ðŸ§± Keyword Difficulty

> ðŸ“Œ **TL;DR:** Difficulty is contextual. Inspect the SERP: authority, intent, content depth, and feature crowding matter more than a single tool score.

## ðŸ§® A Practical KD Framework

```
SERP Authority (0â€“10)  +  Intent Match (0â€“10)  +  Content Gap (0â€“10)  +  Feature Crowd (0â€“10)
â†’ Lower sum = Easier | Higher sum = Harder
```

| Dimension | What to check | Easier | Harder |
|----------|----------------|--------|--------|
| Authority | DR/PA of top results | Low/varied | High/clustered |
| Intent match | Do top 5 share the same content type? | Mixed | Uniform & strong |
| Content gap | Can you be 10x better? | Clear gaps | Saturated |
| Feature crowd | Ads, Shopping, Video, Local pack | Minimal | Heavy |

> [!TIP] If top results are forums, UGC, or thin listicles, thereâ€™s likely room for a high-quality guide or tool.

## ðŸ”Ž Inspecting SERPs Quickly

- Scan titles/H1s for content type (guide, checklist, tool, comparison)
- Note domains: a mix of niche sites vs. only giants?
- Count features: ads, PAAs, featured snippets, carousels
- Check freshness: are winners updated recently?

## ðŸ§­ Strategy by KD

- Easy: publish now; light link support
- Medium: produce best-in-class; internal links + a few strong links
- Hard: build supporting cluster first; target related long-tail; digital PR later

## âœ… Difficulty Checklist

- [ ] Evaluate top 10 URLs for authority and topical fit
- [ ] Assess content depth vs. search intent
- [ ] Note SERP feature crowding (ads, shopping, videos)
- [ ] Estimate link demand vs. your current authority
- [ ] Prefer opportunities where your asset can be 10x better
