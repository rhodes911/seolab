# 🗺️ Map Keywords to Content Types

> 📌 **TL;DR:** Let the SERP guide the asset. Build the same content type users expect—then differentiate with better depth, clarity, and UX.

## 🧭 Mapping Matrix

| Intent | SERP Signals | Content Type | Primary CTA |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Informational | Snippets, PAA, videos | Guide, tutorial | Subscribe/learn |
| Commercial | Listicles, comparisons | "Best" list, vs pages, buyer guide | Compare plans/demo |
| Transactional | Shopping, PLPs | Product/category page | Add to cart |
| Local | Map pack | Local landing page | Call/visit |
| Navigational | Sitelinks | Target page | Navigate |

## ✍️ Crafting Titles & Meta

> Use the Meta Preview widget below to prototype SERP presentation.

- Title: promise + primary modifier (e.g., “Best Project Management Tools for Agencies [2025]”)
- Meta: outcome + differentiator (e.g., “Compare pricing, features, and use cases—expert-vetted picks.”)

## 🧱 Clusters to Pages

```
Cluster: "best crm for smb"
  • Hub: Buyer’s guide (criteria, comparison table)
  • Spokes: industry variants, pricing, migration, vs alternatives
  • Internal links: hub ⇄ each spoke
```
